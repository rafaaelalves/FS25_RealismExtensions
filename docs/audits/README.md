# Audit workspace

One subdirectory per audited external mod.

Minimum audit record:
- exact mod name/version/hash or source commit;
- source availability/license/governance;
- hooks/overwrites/listeners;
- state read/writes;
- overlap with target stack;
- unique phenomena worth retaining;
- performance architecture;
- UI/input footprint;
- multiplayer/persistence behavior;
- recommendation: KEEP, INTEGRATE, FUNCTIONALLY REPLACE, ABSORB, or DO NOT USE.

Never infer an absorption decision from feature similarity alone.

- [TerraFarm deep architecture/compatibility audit](./terrafarm/README.md) — machine lifecycle, TerrainDeformation pipeline, multiplayer/persistence, landscaping areas, official machine-addon extensibility, integration tiers and risk matrix.
